# Cat Image Explorer 🐈

# What was developed

The Cat Image Explorer is a simple web application that allows users to search and display random cat images using [The Cat API](https://developers.thecatapi.com/view-account/ylX4blBYT9FaoVd6OhvR?report=bOoHBz-8t). The application features a button that, when clicked, makes a request to the API and displays a new cat image.

- **Image Search:** By clicking the "CLICK ME!" button, a request is made to The Cat API to obtain a random cat image.
- **Image Display:** The image obtained from the API is displayed on the screen through the InfoCard component.
- **Error Handling:** If an error occurs while fetching the image from the API, an error message is displayed on the screen, and the button remains visible to allow for retries.
